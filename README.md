# Sam Stanford - Sample Work

Hey! Thanks for checking out my GitHub. I tend to not use my public GitHub for much development, so I've added the best of my uni work from the last few years into this directory, and I am working on getting some ecoeats stuff on here too.

## University work

For uni work, I'd recommend reading at least the introduction / overview for each report, then diving into the code. You'll find the report for each piece of work as a PDF in the root of the work's directory alongside the specification provided by the university for the sake of completion.

All of my code is well commented and there are intructions on how to build and run each project in all except a few reports, but feel free to reach out to me if you need a hand getting it working or want to know a little more about a project.

Some projects are single file submissions, including my lecture on data transmission (Data_Transmission_Presentation.mp4), my report on the UK's green energy supply chain security (Supply Chain Security Investigation.pdf), and my heuristic evaluation of Overleaf's LaTeX editor (UI Heuristic Evaluation.pdf).

## Which projects should I look at?

- If you've **only got time to look through one project**, I'd highly recommend looking through **Pub Sub System (Go)**. This project contains some of my best development work for university, complete with unit and integration tests, as well as a clean report.

- If you're looking for some of my **code in a specific language**, the langauge of each project is specified at the end of the directory name in parentheses. Note that I am proficient with more languages than those included.

- If you are looking for **academic work**, I am very proud of my work in **Polynomial-Time Reductions (Python)**, as well as the two individual PDF files, **Supply Chain Security Investigation.pdf** and **UI Heuristic Evaluation.pdf**.

- If you're looking for **networking** experience, check out **P2P File Transfer Application (Java)**.

- If you're looking for **computer architecture** or **OS programming** experience, **File System Implementation (C)** and **Branch Prediction Simulation (Go)** are definitely worth your time to explore.

- If you're looking for something else, be sure to pop me a message on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-stanford/) and I'll help you out.

## Things to keep in mind

- I am always progressing as a developer. I have learned from the mistakes I made yesterday, last week, last month, and last year, meaning **my best work is what I'm doing at the moment, not necessarily what's in this repository**.

- **This is not all the development work I have completed**. Only a small fraction of the work I have completed for ecoeats and Bluestone98 is shown, and there are many more university and personal projects which are not displayed.

- **I am a fast learner**. Don't see a language or framework you were hoping I knew? Chances are I've had experience with it, but if not, I have the skills to learn new languages and systems quickly and effectively.
